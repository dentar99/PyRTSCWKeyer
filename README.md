Python DTR/RTS CW keying program by N4LSJ

For keying, a 5V reed relay with a cap across the contacts to
the rig, and the relay's coil across a GPIO pin and ground,
specified in the keyer= variable will work nicely.
Be sure you know the difference between BOARD and BCM with
regard to the GPIO library before choosing which pins to tie
your relay to.

The first time you run this program, it will ask you for your
Call, WPM.

If you get something wrong, you can edit or delete your .keyer.conf
file and it will build new next time you run the program
